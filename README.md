# Open Blog

I built this blog as a NextJS practice project. Anyone can write new blog posts and delete or edit existing posts.

## Built With:

<a href="https://nextjs.org/"><b>Create Next App</b></a> Used to bootstrap the project. </br>
<a href="https://firebase.google.com/"><b>Firebase</b></a> Used Firebase Realtime Database to store blog posts. </br>

## Features

<ul>
    <li>Create new posts (click 'Create a Post')</li>
    <li>Edit posts (open a post and click 'Edit' under the image)</li>
    <li>Delete posts (open a post and click 'Delete' under the image)</li>
</ul>
